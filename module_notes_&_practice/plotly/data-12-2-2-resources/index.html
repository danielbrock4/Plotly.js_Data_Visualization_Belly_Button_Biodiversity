<!--Make sure that your files are linked correctly and in the right order. Since Roza needs the Plotly CDN
  to use Plotly, the CDN <script> tag should come 1st. Since she will also need the data to load before using
  Plotly, the data file should be linked next. Finally, the script file is linked.-->
